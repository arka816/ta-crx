And the floor was filled with\ndirt.\n\n\u2022 Filled with mosquitos and weird\nbugs.\n\n\u2022 Seats, window locks and handles\nbroken/torn.\n\n\u2022 The train just traveled on the road\nand no scenic view was visible.\n\n\u2022 The train was delayed by 2 hours.\n\n\u2022 Wasted my whole day and was not\nable to visit any tourist place apart\nof the dirty railway station.\n\n\u2022 The only thing the train was best at\nis noise and air pollution. ( I went\non a steam train)\n\n\u2022 Got a headache from all the\nunnecessary horns.\n\n\u2022 The train had SPIDERS from like\nAustralia or smtg.\n\nI do not recommend to visit this overhyped place. Go to Shimla if you want a FAR better experience. Or just atleast remove this as one of the world Heritage places for the sake of the reputation of Indians/India at least.",

Darjeeling Himalayan Railways (DHR) consists of a small ( Narrow Gauge) single line from Darjeeling all the way to New Jalpaiguri but tourists usually\nundertake the joy ride (round trip from Darjeeling to Ghum and back). This joy ride is a must do thing while you are in Darjeeling particularly if you have kids in your group. Even for adults it is real fun traversing through the town - at times almost as if piercing THROUGH the buildings on the road - very much reminiscent of Kolkata trams. The round trip of Darjeeling - Ghum - Darjeeling takes around 100 mts. The train stops at Batasia Loop for 20 mts and for 15 mts at Ghum, which happens to be the highest Rail station in India. Batasia Loop is an excellent place for photography offering panoramic views of the Darjeeling city from a height. At Ghum, you can visit the small Rail Museum built at the station itself, have snacks and tea and click photographs. There are some heritage wagons and coaches, selfie points and a heritage Steam Loco where you can get clicked posing as a train driver ! Alternatively, you can visit the Ghum Monastery which is a little way up from the station and you have to walk brisk to cover it within the 15 mts stoppage time. Normally they attach only 2 coaches and the first coach in the UP direction becomes the rear coach in DN after loco reversal at Ghum. Production of Steam engines has been stopped by Indian Railways but at this UNESCO heritage site, you can witness first hand how they actually coal the fire and operate a Steam loco - a unique experience.",

Departing very late.\n\nWe were on the steam locomotive trip and the locomotive spewed soot/ash onto our car and into our compartment. It was on everything and in my hair. Some of the ash was very hot and singed my skin.\n\nDid I mention that you should wear hearing protection? 103 db whistle blowing all the time.\n\nI suggest looking at the locomotives and calling it good. I had hoped for better photo opportunities but it didn\u2019t happen.",
